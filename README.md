# App Joke 

I created a small app that allows consuming the API from : https://www.blablagues.net/apix.html  
I did this just for fun and to have some jokes to tell at parties ;P

I also did this to practice with ViteJS + ReactJS + Tailwind CSS

Thanks to: [blagues.net](https://www.blablagues.net), who provides the API for free so that developers (junior and experienced) can benefit from it.
